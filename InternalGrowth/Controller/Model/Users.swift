## Relationships

`currentUser` will always hold the currently logged-in user so that their data is saved and stored properly.
 
 - Bug:
There are *potential* (not confirmed) bugs when authenticating, so be wary of this crucial variable if reflections and experiences do not appear in the library. May appear as `nil` in inopportune times, but is rare.
 
- Remark:
    See LoginViewController.swift for its implementation in the authorization section
